# Why Use OpenModelZ?

OpenModelZ is a CLI tool that helps you deploy your models to any cloud (GCP, AWS, or others), your home lab, or even a single machine.

## Who is using OpenModelZ?

OpenModelZ lies at the heart of the [ModelZ](https://modelz.ai) platform. It's used to deploy models for our customers.

## What is the benefit?

We created OpenModelZ in response to the difficulties of finding a simple, cost-effective way to get models into production fast. Traditional deployment methods can be complex and time-consuming, requiring significant effort and resources to get models up and running.

- Kubernetes: Setting up and maintaining Kubernetes and Kubeflow can be challenging due to their technical complexity. Data scientists spend significant time configuring and debugging infrastructure instead of focusing on model development.
- Managed services: Alternatively, using a managed service like AWS SageMaker can be expensive and inflexible, limiting the ability to customize deployment options.
- Virtual machines: As an alternative, setting up a cloud VM-based solution requires learning complex infrastructure concepts like load balancers, ingress controllers, and other components. This takes a lot of specialized knowledge and resources.

With OpenModelZ, we take care of the underlying technical details for you, and provide a simple and easy-to-use CLI to deploy your models to any cloud (GCP, AWS, or others), your home lab, or even a single machine.
