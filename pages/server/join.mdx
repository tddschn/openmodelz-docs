# Add More Servers

You could join a new server to the cluster by running `mdz server join` on the new server if you want to add more servers to your cluster.

You could provide the internal IP address of the first server to the `mdz server join` command.

```
$ mdz server join <internal-ip-of-the-first-server>
$ mdz server list
 NAME   PHASE  ALLOCATABLE      CAPACITY        
 node1  Ready  cpu: 16          cpu: 16         
               mem: 32784748Ki  mem: 32784748Ki 
 node2  Ready  cpu: 16          cpu: 16         
               mem: 32784748Ki  mem: 32784748Ki 
```
